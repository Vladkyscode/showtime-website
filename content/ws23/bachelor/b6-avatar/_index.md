{{<section title="Our Goal">}}

Our goal has two main parts: First, we want to create an awesome **learning environment** using virtual reality. Picture a space where learning about electrical circuits is like an exciting adventure. Which can completely convey the worlds of electronics without any real dangers. 

Second, we aim to figure out, through tests, which **avatar** – be it a futuristic robot or a realistic human – works better. We're curious to discover which one builds more trust and makes the learning experience even better. Join us as we build a unique learning world and find out which avatar brings the most excitement and trust to your educational journey!
