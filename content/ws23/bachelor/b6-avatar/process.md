## Planning and Preparation

We began our journey with careful planning and preparations. After diving into scientific papers to gather insights, we crafted our questionnaire for the tests. The scientific findings from the sources were our support throughout the entire project.

## Game Development using Unity

Our game took shape within Unity. Collaborating with our partner from sE.services GmbH, we discussed its appearance, content, and functionality. We had weekly meetings with each other and always shared our progress with our supervisors, gathering feedback. Two rooms were designed and developed, characters were selected, and interactive elements were programmed, so the environment became more like a game. By working with our partner, we have also given voice and movement to our avatars.

## Testing and Evaluation

In the final step, we tested our learning setup with different groups. One group interacted with the robot version, while the other engaged with the realistic human avatar. After that, participants shared their feedback by filling out our questionnaire, revealing their experiences. We then analyzed this information to determine which teaching approach worked better.



This journey followed a systematic approach, rooted in scientific research and collaborative development. It wasn't solely about creating an learning experience in a virtual environment; it was a well-organized effort filled with ideas, teamwork, and effective knowledge-sharing methods.
