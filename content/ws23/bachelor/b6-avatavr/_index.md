Rapid advancements in Virtual Reality (VR) technology have transformed what was once dismissed by many as a 'gimmick' into a rapidly evolving realm with practical applications.
Companies like Meta and Valve now prioritize VR technologies, aiming to seamlessly integrate them into our daily lives. 
The Covid-19 pandemic further accelerated the shift of education into the virtual space, emphasizing the growing importance of immersive learning experiences.
In this context, our study, AvataVR, focuses on examining the visual impact of VR learning, specifically exploring the potential of avatars to enhance educational experiences within this evolving virtual landscape.

{{<section title="Concept">}}
The concept involves constructing an immersive VR application, ranging from 5 to 10 minutes, designed to investigate the effects of different avatars on the learner. 
In this application, an avatar introduces itself and provides a short instructional session, enabling the study of various impact factors.
To make this instructional session as hands-on as possible, we partnered with the company se.services.

Collaborating with their Training Coordinator Markus Zippel, who has trained countless of electricians during his career, we crafted a scenario to later evaluate the users experience.{{</section>}}

{{<section title="Technical Implementation">}}

The application was developed using the OpenXR Library in the Unity game engine. 
Thanks to the library's unified interface, it is possible to play the scene with all common VR headsets without the need for scene rewriting. 
In our case, we had access to modern Oculus Quest headsets, which are relatively consumer-friendly as they do not require external sensors to be set up in the room.
